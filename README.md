# navigation
this is a simple project that makes use of web development skills to create a website and implement features like buttons, and allows one to redirect to other links. When they navigate to the navigation page, they can search for particular locations within a campus, in this case, my institution, we can look for the library, first block, and so on. We can then see a map showing the college on a map, with the location of the selected place being marked on the map
